# deepfake_detetection
This repository contains the implementation of the master’s capstone project “Deepfake Detection Using Deep Learning Models and Interactive Dashboard Deployment.” It focuses on detecting AI-generated faces using the Kaggle “140K Real and Fake Faces” dataset, which combines real FFHQ images with StyleGAN-generated fake faces at 256×256 resolution.
